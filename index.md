# Dog Identification project
# Udacity's Data Scientist nanodegree capstone project.

## Project Overview:
Computer vision with deep learning have advanced drastically in last few years. That all is thanks to the Convolutional Neural Networks. This helps in many fields, from autonomous vehicles to medical imaging. In this project we aim to use this technology in identifying dog breeeds from photos. All the data and pretrained models where supplied by the udacity team in the workspace.

## Problem Statement:
